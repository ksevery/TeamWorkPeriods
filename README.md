# TeamWorkPeriods
Finding the two employees who've worked together the longest

# Usage
The client is a console application which, upon starting, will prompt you to input a path to a file containing data that looks like the following:

    143, 12, 2010-11-01, 2017-11-06
    218, 10, 2012-05-16, NULL
    143, 10, 2009-01-01, 2011-04-27
    144, 10, 2009-01-01, 2013-04-27
    145, 10, 2009-01-01, 2014-04-27
    146, 10, 2009-01-01, NULL
    147, 12, 2011-11-01, NULL

Check the test files in the root of the project for some simple samples [Test file](test.txt)

The output from running it will produce the IDs of the two employees who've worked together the longest, and the time for which they have worked together.
